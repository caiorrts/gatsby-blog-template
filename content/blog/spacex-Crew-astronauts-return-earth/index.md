SpaceX returned four astronauts to Earth early Sunday after a six-month stay on the International Space Station, splashing them down in the Gulf of Mexico. It was the first nighttime US splashdown since Apollo 8 in 1968.

The Crew-1 astronauts, three American and one Japanese, landed near Panama City, Florida, just before 3 a.m. ET. It was the second time humans have returned to Earth on a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule.
